##FAQ

**Q: What difference does ArchStrike have from other penetration distributions?**

A: Our first official release was made! You can [download from here](https://archstrike.org/downloads).

A: Send us a mail, join our IRC channel or contact us via github. All are fine.

**Q: I am having trouble installing ArchStrike, can you help me?**

A: Sure! Send us an email or join our IRC channel.

**Q: What is the archstrike-testing repository and do I need it?**

A: The testing repository is merely a quality control mechanism we have in place. When new tools are added, they stay in testing until they are verified to be functioning correctly. Most of the packages in testing build and work fine but some may have problems. If you want to have the full range of tools that we provide, go ahead and add the testing repository as well.
